# node-devtools-server-timing
Node.js-based profiler that takes advantage of capability provided by Chrome DevTools to report and present the server timings. Inspired by [Tip #136](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/136-server-timing/) from great [/dev tips](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/) of [Umar Hansa](https://github.com/umaar)

## Disclaimer
This is really WIP (work-in-progress). Already working but not yet unit-tested, or having API set in stone.
